The installation consists of 4 phases:

 - compile fire
 - install an apache server
 - setup the FIRE webinterface in the apache server
 - index a database to use FIRE

This is a basic setup. Advanced use might require some tweaking on your side.

==== INSTALL FIRE ====
How to install fire:

1. download the FIRE sources from http://thomas.deselaers.de/FIRE
   [you have probably done that, since you are reading this file]
   and unpack it.

2. if you plan to use fire on several architectures set the ARCH
   variable to the one that you are currently using, otherwise, just leave
   it as it is.

3. You need several libraries installed. Most important ist ImageMagick
   with C++ bindings. I am using  version 6.2.4.

   All other libraries used by FIRE are disabled by default. You might
   want to try to enable some of them, but I suggest first compiling and
   testing the base version of FIRE.

4. Run "make" in the fire main directory.
   this will take a while and will usually generate a lot of warnings due
   to disabled libraries. Normally there should be no errors.

5. After you have done so, you can check that a whole bunch of binaries was
   created in <FIRE DIR>/bin/$ARCH 

6. If there are 52 binaries, everything was built, otherwise, something might be missing.
   For the remainder of this description, you will need only three of these binaries:
     - fire
     - extractcolorhistogram
     - extracttamuratexturefeature



==== INSTALL APACHE ====
Now you need to install an apache for the webinterface.
* You can also use a webserver that is already installed with your system,
  but then you need to change the following steps according to your
  installation. 

1. download the apache source
   I used http://apache.linux-mirror.org/httpd/httpd-2.2.8.tar.gz
2. unpack it
   tar -xzf httpd-2.2.8.tar.gz
3. compile it 
   Here are the steps I did
 
   - cd http-2.2.8
   - ./configure --prefix=$HOME/apache   // again, you are free to change this.
   - make 
   - make install

4. you have now successfully installed apache. Since I am not running apache as root, I change the
   apache config as follows:
     -  edit $HOME/apache/conf/httpd.conf
       - change the line 
          Listen 80 
         to
          Listen 12345
         to make the server run on a non-reserved port
       - change the email address in the ServerAdmin-line to my email address
5. start $HOME/apache/bin/httpd
6. check that I have a "It works"-message when browing to http://localhost:12345
7. stop apache again by $HOME/apache/bin/apachectk stop

==== INSTALL THE WEBINTERFACE TO FIRE ====
The following procedure puts some images into weird places... but it 
is the easiest way to make this work. So, you might want to change some of the settings in 
config.py at a later time and remove some of the images.

1. copy from the WebInterface folder in the FIRE source into the cgi-bin directory of the apache installation
  cp <FIRE DIR>/WebInterface/*.py $HOME/apache/cgi-bin
2. make the cgi file executable:
  chmod 755 ~/apache/cgi-bin//*.py
3. cp <FIRE DIR>/Python/firesocket.py $HOME/apache/cgi-bin/  
4. cp <FIRE DIR>/WebInterface/fire-template.html $HOME/apache/cgi-bin/
5. mkdir $HOME/apache/htdocs/images
6. mkdir $HOME/apache/cgi-bin/images
7. cp <FIRE DIR>WebInterface/*.png $HOME/apache/htdocs/images
8. cp <FIRE DIR>WebInterface/*.png $HOME/apache/cgi-bin/images


==== INDEX A SMALL DATABASE FOR FIRE ====
1. have a directory with some (~100) reasonably sized (in the order of 500x500 pixel) images.
   In the following, I will use the SHORTCUT $IMGDIR  for this
2. extract color histograms for the images:
  $FIREDIR/bin/extractcolorhistogram --color --images $IMGDIR/*.jpg
3. extract tamura texture histograms for the images:
  $FIREDIR/bin/extracttamuratexturefeature --saveHistogram tamura.histo.gz --images $IMGDIR/*.jpg
4. create a filelist: 
  cd $IMGDIR
  echo "FIRE_filelist" > list
  echo "path $IMGDIR" >> list
  echo "suffix color.histo.gz" >> list
  echo "suffix tamura.histo.gz" >> list
  ls *.jpg | awk '{print "file",$1}' >> list
5. the create list then looks like this:

FIRE_filelist
path /u/deselaers/tmp/img/
suffix color.histo.gz
suffix tamura.histo.gz
file 100.jpg
file 101.jpg
file 102.jpg
....


==== STARTING FIRE ====
start fire.
  $FIREDIR/bin/fire -f $IMGDIR/list -D -r 10

use the webinterface: 
  http://localhost:12345/cgi-bin/fire.py
