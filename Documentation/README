README for FIRE -- Flexible Image Retrieval Engine V2

Sorry, here is nearly no information so far. 

Just: If you want to work with FIRE, use this version not the old one.

  To use local features in fire, several steps are necessary to reach
  one of the possible ways to use local features.

  If you want to use global local feature distance:
    necesarry steps:
      1. extract local features
          this will most probably include calculating the PCA of the extracted features
         tool: extractlocalfeatures

      2. create a kd-tree of the local features to be loaded in the global local feature distance
         tool: createlfkdtree
          
      3. run fire with appropriate options -d X globallocalfeaturedistance:TREE=<file where the tree is saved>
         this is currently not possible in the webinterface
     
      NOTE: this may be very inefficient if lots of local features are
      loaded. Especially it is very memory hungry as the local
      features are stored twice: once in the tree and once for the
      images.

  If you want to use local feature histograms:
      1. extract local features
          this will most probably include calculating the PCA of the extracted features
          tool: extraclocalfeatures
      2. cluster the local features and create histograms:
          tool: lfclustering


          note: if you have a distinguished set of test and train data
          you have to process these separately as well in step 1 as in step 2.
          for this case extraclocalfeatures and lfclustering offer
          options to load the appropriate pca and clustermodel respectively

      3. run fire with appropriate options.
         that is, you have to load the features and select a suitable distance measure for histograms
